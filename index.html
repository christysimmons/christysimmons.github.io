  <h2>Hello, world.</h2>
   <p>Hi, hello there! This page is a very simple host for Christy Simmon's portfolio because she thought it was a good plan to tear down her personal site right before the busy season. Sometimes she has a problem keeping up with her ambition. It happens to the best of us... or at least all of us.</p>
   <p>You can visit her linkedin page <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ceemosimmons" target="blank">here</a>. She doesn't do much by way of social media ever since that one time. It got a little weird, much like continuing to write about one's self in the third person once one becomes aware of it. Christina -- I -- recommend dropping both if you ever have the chance.</p>
